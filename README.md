NEMegy (a window into the National Electricty Market)

Nemegy (excuse the NEM and energy pun) was a passion project designed to gain a deeper view of the NEM.
NEMegy allows a user to view the energy marketplace from two different perspectives

view the energy production and prices from the point of view of a state. this is best suited for those looking to quickly identify major trends and the likely future directions for NEM.
view energy information from individual stations. this is an important tool to understand the different types of power stations that make up the entire energy landscape. for example, how does the price of electricity vary from a solar farm to a wind farm? what about a gas plant?
NEMegy provides infographics of many useful metrics such as $/MWh, and $/tCO2e over the timeframe the user is interested in, ranging from the past 7 days to the beginning of the plant's life.

NEMegy also provides insight into potential future trends using machine learning forecast methods. this forecasting is powered by Meta (formerly Facebook) open-source Prophet. which is measured against other competitor tools to assess the accuracy of forecasts.

Massive thanks to the team at OPENNEM for their API which is used in part 2. of this project.
